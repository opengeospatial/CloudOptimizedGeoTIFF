[big]*i.     Abstract*

The Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) relies on two characteristics of the TIFF v6 format (tiles and reduced resolution subfiles), GeoTIFF keys for georeference, and the HTTP range, which allows for efficient downloading of parts of imagery and grid coverage data on the web and to make fast data visualization of TIFF or BigTIFF files and fast geospatial processing workflows possible.
COG-aware applications can download only the information they need to visualize or process the data on the web. Numerous remote sensing datasets are available in cloud storage facilities that can benefit from optimized visualization and processing.
This standard formalizes the requirements for a TIFF file to become a COG file and for the HTTP server to make COG files available in a fast fashion on the web.

The key work for crafting this OGC Standard was undertaken in the Open-Earth-Monitor Cyberinfrastructure (OEMC) project, which received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement number 101059548 and in the All Data 4 Green Deal - An Integrated, FAIR Approach for the Common European Data Space (AD4GD) project, which received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation program under grant agreement number 101061001.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

COG was previously defined by a community of users with the intention of improving the distribution of remote sensing images on the cloud. This document respects the decisions taken and conventions adopted by the community and formalizes them in standard requirements and recommendations. The Standard name still reflects this original purpose: a format optimized for the cloud.  Similar principles are applied to other emerging formats such as Zarr (https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (https://copc.io/).

This document depends on the TIFF specification and the OGC GeoTIFF Standard. For big files, it may depend on the BigTIFF specification. The Standard takes advantage of some existing characteristics of the TIFF specification and the existing HTTP range specification and does not modify them in anyway.

[big]*iv.    Security Considerations*

COG mainly describes a data format. Security considerations for implementations utilizing COG are in the domain of the implementing application, deployment platform, operating system, networking environment, and web browsers.

In general, this Standard does not place constraints on application, platform, operating system level, network, or web browser security. However, this Standard has a requirements class that requires "HTTP range." Attention has been made to also allow secure variants of HTTP such as HTTPS and still be able to mix data from different origins in web browsers using HTTP range. In that respect, considerations to support Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) are done in the document. In particular, servers are encouraged to advertise the support for HTTP ranges in the Control-Allow-Headers header to allow for HTTPS CORS.

NOTE: The security measures discussed in the following sections only allow various kinds of authentication under HTTPS. HTTPS only provides confidentiality or encryption at the protocol level. Confidentiality or encryption at the data level is not discussed by this Standard.
