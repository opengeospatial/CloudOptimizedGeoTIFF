|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/rec/geotiff/ifd-order
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE}| In a COG file, and after the TIFF/BigTIFF header/signature and pointer to first IFD (and an eventual _ghost area_) sections SHOULD follow the following order:

1. IFD of the full resolution image, followed by TIFF tags values, excluding the TileOffsets and TileByteCounts arrays.

2. IFD of the mask of the full resolution image, if present, followed by TIFF tags values, excluding the TileOffsets and TileByteCounts arrays.

3. IFD of the first (largest in dimensions) Reduced-Resolution Subfile, if present

4. ...(there may be several sections for IFD of intermediate dimensions)

5. IFD of the last (smallest) Reduced-Resolution Subfile, if present

6. IFD of the first (largest in dimensions) Reduced-Resolution Subfile of the mask, if present

7. ...(there may be several sections or IFD of intermediate dimensions for the mask)

8. IFD of the last (smallest) Reduced-Resolution Subfile of the mask, if present TileOffsets and TileByteCounts arrays of the above IFDs

9. tile data of the smallest Reduced-Resolution Subfile, if present (with each tile followed by the corresponding tile of mask data, if present), with leader and trailer bytes

10. ...(there may be several tile data sections of intermediate resolutions).

11. tile data of the largest Reduced-Resolution Subfile, if present (interleaved with mask data if present)

12. tile data of the full resolution image, if present (interleaved with corresponding mask data if present)
