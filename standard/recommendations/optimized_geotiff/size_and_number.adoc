| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE}|
A COG file SHOULD define TileWidth and TileLength as a power of two.
| B {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE}|
All tiles in the file SHUOLD have the same TileWidth and TileLength. Recomended values are 256, 512 or 1024
| C {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE}| 
The size of a pixel (a.k.a resolution) _r_ of the _n_ reduced resolution subfile SHOULD be generated by this formula: _r~n~=2^n^ r~0~_ (where r~0~ is the size of a pixel of the original image).
