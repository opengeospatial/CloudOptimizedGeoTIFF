|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/geotiff-overviews/overviews
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | A COG file SHALL have at least one IFD with a NewSubfileType tag whose bit 0 is *not* set, or without a  NewSubfileType tag (full-resolution image data).  {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
| B {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | An IFD with a NewSubfileType tag whose bit 0 is *not* set, or without a  NewSubfileType tag SHALL have an offset to the next IFD that will point to an IFD with a NewSubfileType tag whose bit 0 is set (reduced-resolution image data) if there is one, or an offset to the next full-resolution image data (e.g., another band or a mask) or an offset 0 if there is no other image. {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
| C {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | This IFD with a NewSubfileType tag whose bit 0 is set SHALL have an Image Width an Image Height inferior than the previous IFD.  {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
| D {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | If other reduced resolution images are needed, a IFD with a NewSubfileType tag whose bit 0 is set SHALL have an offset to the next IFD that will point to an IFD with a NewSubfileType tag whose bit 0 is set (reduced-resolution image data). {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
| E {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | This additional IFD with a NewSubfileType tag whose bit 0 is set SHALL have an Image Width an Image Height inferior than the previous IFD.  {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
| F {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | When no additional reduced-resolution image data is available for this image, the IFD SHALL have an offset to the next IFD pointing to the next full-resolution image data (e.g. another band or a mask) or an offset 0 if there is no other image.  {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}

NOTE: The wording of this requirement is complex due to the possible presence of several images (e.g. bands or masks) in the file. In essence, it says that for a single image, the full resolution image IFD should be immediately linked to its overview IFDs. If there is more than one image in the file, the last overview IFD of the previous image will linked to the full resolution next image IFD.
