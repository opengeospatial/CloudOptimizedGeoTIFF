|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}|/req/optimized_geotiff/number
| A {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | A COG file SHALL contain reduced resolution subfiles each one reducing the resolution by a maximum factor of 10 from the previous one.
| B {set:cellbgcolor:#EEEEEE} | In a COG file, the last reduced resolution subfile (the one with bigger pixel size) SHALL have TilesAcross or TilesDown equal to one.
|===

NOTE: A common way to implement this requirement is to define the resolution _r_ of the _n_ reduced resolution subfile as: _r~n~=2^n^ r~0~_ (where r~0~ is the resolution of the original image)
