== Terms and Definitions
This document used the terms defined in https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/directives/directives.php[OGC Policy Directive 49], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard and OGC documents do not use the equivalent phrases in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

This document also uses terms defined in the OGC Standard for Modular specifications (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3]), also known as the 'ModSpec'. The definitions of terms such as standard, specification, requirement, and conformance test are provided in the ModSpec.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

=== cloud computing::

on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user [Wikipedia]

=== geokey::

key in a  GeoTIFF  equivalent in function to a TIFF tag, but using a different offset mechanism

=== GeoTIFF::

standard for storing georeference and geocoding information in a TIFF 6.0 compliant raster file or in a BigTIFF [GeoTIFF Format Specification 1.0, modified]

=== overview::

downsampled versions of the same image.

NOTE: There is no mention of the term _overview_ in the TIFF v6 specification. This standard favors the use of the expression Reduced-Resolution Subfile to talk about an _overview_

=== tag::

packet of numerical or ASCII values, which have a numerical TIFF "Tag" identifier indicating their information content

=== tile::

geometric shape with known properties that may or may not be the result of a tiling (tessellation) process. A tile consists of a single connected "piece" (topological disc) without "holes" or "lines" [OGC 19-014r3]+

In the context of a 2D _tile matrix_, a _tile_ is one of the rectangular regions of space, which can be uniquely identified by an integer row and column, making up the tile matrix.

In the context of a geospatial data _tile set_, a _tile_ contains data for such a partition of space as part of an overall set of tiles for that tiled geospatial data. [OGC 2DTMS]

=== subfile::

mechanism for including multiple images in a single TIFF file based on the use of IFDs
